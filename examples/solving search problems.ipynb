Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes that were encountered but not yet explored.\n",

    "As you may have noticed above in the diagram, the dependencies indicate that the graph has 3 paths at it's widest, whereby it would be logical to assign 3 CPUs to compute the tasks. However a little search can illustrate that it is possible to solve the tasks with 2 CPUs without extending the critical path.\n",
