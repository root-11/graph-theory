NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) is a genetic algorithm (GA) for 
the generation of evolving artificial neural networks (a neuroevolution 
technique) developed by Ken Stanley in 2002 while at The University of Texas 
at Austin. It alters both the weighting parameters and structures of networks, 
attempting to find a balance between the fitness of evolved solutions and their 
diversity. It is based on applying three key techniques: tracking genes with 
history markers to allow crossover among topologies, applying speciation (the 
evolution of species) to preserve innovations, and developing topologies 
incrementally from simple initial structures.
