    # The algorithm
    # I reviewed a number of algorithms, such as Ford-fulkerson algorithm,
    # Edmonson-Karp and Dinic, but I didn't like them due to their naive usage
    # of DFS, which leads to a lot of node visits.
    #
    # I therefore choose to invert the capacities of the graph so that the
    # capacity any G[u][v] = c becomes 1/c in G_inverted.
    # This allows me to use the shortest path method to find the path with
    # most capacity in the first attempt, resulting in a significant reduction
    # of unassigned flow.
    #
    # By updating G_inverted, with the residual capacity, I can keep using the
    # shortest path, until the capacity is zero, whereby I remove the links
    # When the shortest path method returns 'No path' or when unassigned flow
    # is zero, I exit the algorithm.
    #
    # Even on small graphs, this method is very efficient, despite the overhead
    # of using shortest path. For very large graphs, this method outperforms
    # all other algorithms by orders of magnitude.
