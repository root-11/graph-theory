    # capacity any G[u][v] = c becomes 1/c in G_inverted.

    # most capacity in the first attempt, resulting in a significant reduction
    # of unassigned flow.

    # shortest path, until the capacity is zero, whereby I remove the links
    # When the shortest path method returns 'No path' or when unassigned flow
    # is zero, I exit the algorithm.
    #
    # Even on small graphs, this method is very efficient, despite the overhead
    # of using shortest path. For very large graphs, this method outperforms
    # all other algorithms by orders of magnitude.

    This is useful for determining which tasks can be performed in 
    parallel. Each phase in the phaselines must be completed to assure
    that the tasks in the next phase can be performed with complete input.

    This is in contrast to Topological sort that only generates
    a queue of tasks, may be fine for a single processor, but has no 
    mechanism for coordination that all inputs for a task have been completed
    so that multiple processors can work on them.

    Example: DAG with tasks:
    
        u1      u4      u2      u3
        \       \       \_______\

        \       \           \
        op1     \           op3
        \       \           \
        op2     \           cs2
        \       \___________\
        cs1         join
        \           \
        map1        map2
        \___________\
            save

    phaselines = {
        "u1": 0, "u4": 0, "u2": 0, "u3": 0, 
        "csg": 1, "cs3": 1, "append": 1,

        "map1": 5, "map2": 5,
        "save": 6,
    }  

    From this example it is visible that processing the 4 'uN' (uploads) is
    the highest degree of concurrency. This can be determined as follows:

        d = defaultdict(int)
        for _, pl in graph.phaselines():

        max_processors = max(d, key=d.get)

    :param graph: Graph
    :return: dictionary with node id : phase in cut.

    Note: To transform the phaselines into a task sequence use
    the following recipe:

    tasks = defaultdict(set)
    for node, phase in phaselines(graph):
        tasks[phase].add(node)

    :return: shortest path

    In Section 3.4.6 of Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, Russel and
    Norvig write:

    Bidirectional search is implemented by replacing the goal test with a check
    to see whether the frontiers of the two searches intersect; if they do,
    a solution has been found. It is important to realize that the first solution
    found may not be optimal, even if the two searches are both breadth-first;
    some additional search is required to make sure there isn't a shortcut
    across the gap.

    To overcome this limit for weighted graphs, I've added a lower bound, so
    that when the two searches intersect, the lower bound is updated and the
    lower bound path is stored. In subsequent searches any path shorter than
    the lower bound, leads to an update of the lower bound and shortest path.
    The algorithm stops when all nodes on the frontier exceed the lower bound.

    ----------------

    The algorithms works as follows:

    Lower bound = float('infinite')
    shortest path = None

    Two queues (forward scan and backward scan) are initiated with respectively
    the start and end node as starting point for each scan.

    while there are nodes in the forward- and backward-scan queues:
        1. select direction from (forward, backward) in alternations.
        2. pop the top item from the queue of the direction.
           (The top item contains the node N that is nearest the starting point for the scan)
        3. Add the node N to the scan-directions frontier.
        4. If the node N is in the other directions frontier:
            the path distance from the directions _start_ to the _end_ via
            the point of intersection (N), is compared with the lower bound.

            If the path distance is less than the lower bound:
            *lower bound* is updated with path distance, and,
            the *shortest path* is recorded.

        5. for each node N2 (to N if backward, from N if forward):
            the distance D is accumulated

            if D > lower bound, the node N2 is ignored.

            if N2 is within the other directions frontier and D + D.other > lower bound, the node N2 is ignored.

            otherwise:
                the path P recorded
                and N2, D and P are added to the directions scan queue

    The algorithm terminates when the scan queues are exhausted.
    ----------------

    Given that:
    - `c` is the connectivity of the nodes in the graph,
    - `R` is the length of the path,
    the explored solution landscape can be estimated as:

    A = c * (R**2), for single source shortest path
    A = c * 2 * (1/2 * R) **2, for bidirectional shortest path
