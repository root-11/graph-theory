    ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM

    Definition:

    The problem instance has a number of agents and a number of tasks.
    Any agent can be assigned to perform any task, incurring some cost that may
    vary depending on the agent-task assignment. It is required to perform all
    tasks by assigning exactly one agent to each task and exactly one task to each
    agent in such a way that the total cost of the assignment is minimized.[1]

    Variations:

    - If there are more agents than tasks the problem can be solved by creating a
    "do nothing tasks" with a cost of zero. The assignment problem solver does this
    automatically.

    - If there are more tasks than agents then the problem is a knapsack problem.
    The assignment problem solver handles this case gracefully too.

    Solution methods:

    1. Using maximum flow method.
    2. Using alternating iterative auction.

    [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem

    ----------------------------------------------------

    The assignment problem solver expects a bi-partite graph
    with agents, tasks and the value/cost of each task, as links,
    so that the relationship is explicit as:

        value = g.edge(agent 1, task 1)

    The optimal assignment is determined as an alternating auction
    (see Dmitri Bertsekas, MIT) which maximises the value.
    Once all agents are assigned the alternating auction halts.

    :return: optimal assignment as list of edges (agent, task, value)

    Weapons target assignment problem (WTAP)

    The problem instance has a number weapons which can be assigned
    to engage targets, with a success rate of P(x). Targets have values V.
    If a weapon is engaged against a target, and is successful, the value is
    reduced to zero. Expected outcome of an engagement (D,T) is thereby

        O = V * (1-P(x))

    The optimal assignment is minimises the value of the targets.

        min E( O )

    for more see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_target_assignment_problem

    Variations:

    - if V is unknown, use v = 1. This maximises the exploitation of the available
    probabilities.

    Method used:

    1. initial assignment using greedy algorithm;
    2. followed by search for improvements.
